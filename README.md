# Bitcoin Memory Palace

**AI-Powered Collective Intelligence for Bitcoin**

## What is Bitcoin Memory Palace?

Bitcoin Memory Palace is the world's first AI-powered collective intelligence network for Bitcoin. Every user experience shared makes Bitcoin smarter - transforming individual memories into collective wisdom.

## The Problem

Bitcoin adoption data is fragmented across social media, forums, and word-of-mouth. There's no centralized way to learn from real user experiences, identify adoption patterns, or query collective Bitcoin knowledge.
