# Bitcoin Memory Palace

**AI-Powered Collective Intelligence for Bitcoin**

Stacks Vibe Coding Hackathon 2025

## What is Bitcoin Memory Palace?

Bitcoin Memory Palace is the world's first AI-powered collective intelligence network for Bitcoin. Every user experience shared makes Bitcoin smarter - transforming individual memories into collective wisdom through advanced AI analysis.

## The Problem

Bitcoin adoption insights are scattered across:
- Social media platforms
- Reddit and forums
- Word-of-mouth experiences
- Fragmented data sources

There's no unified way to:
- Learn from real Bitcoin user experiences
- Identify emerging adoption patterns
- Query collective Bitcoin knowledge
- Make data-driven decisions about Bitcoin utility
- Track sentiment and geographic trends

## Our Solution

A revolutionary system that collects, analyzes, and synthesizes Bitcoin experiences:

1. **Collects** - Users share Bitcoin experiences in natural language
2. **Analyzes** - AI processes each memory for sentiment, topics, patterns
3. **Synthesizes** - Generates collective insights from all data
4. **Responds** - Answers questions using accumulated wisdom

Think of it as Bitcoin's Collective Brain - growing smarter with every shared experience.

## Key Features

### Memory Submission System
- Natural language input - no technical knowledge required
- Instant AI analysis with sentiment detection

- Optional location tagging for geographic insights
- Real-time processing and feedback

### AI-Powered Analysis Engine
- Advanced sentiment analysis (positive/negative/neutral)
- Automatic keyword and topic extraction
- Bitcoin relevance scoring
- Confidence metrics for each analysis
- Pattern recognition across submissions

### Collective Insights Generation
